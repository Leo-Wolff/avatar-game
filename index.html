            <p>
                In honour of Mako is a game created to let YOU master your element.
                The name comes from the voice actor Mako - who voiced General Iroh - and it is in the honour of his memory and his beautiful work.

                Click on your trainer to begin training in bending.
                At every click you learn a new part of a bending move.
                Master every single form of a bending move to learn it.
                However, training costs thirst.
                Replenish your thrist at the Jasmine Dragon.
                At the arena you can showcase your moves.
                Watch out! Using bending costs chi.
                To replenish your chi, meditate at Mako's tree.
